# Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms with Leetcode

Welcome to Bee's guide to datastructures and algorithms! This is based on [https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare)

**You can read this here** [https://beesec.gitbook.io/algorithms/](https://beesec.gitbook.io/algorithms/)

This is a course on datastructures and algorithms based around leetcode problems. Learn DS&A via problems, with lengthy explanations. 

This guide is ordered by how likely it is for that datastructure / algorithm to show up in an interview **and** how vital that knowledge is to understanding other data structures / algorithms.

Each section will lead with a leetcode style problem, and end with problems you can do on your own. This way, you only ever learn what is relevant. 

All code will be in Python due to how easy it is to read. If you want to contribute more code, feel free to. This is on GitHub after all!

If you're okay with Python, but want to learn the advanced stuff check out my other book [https://github.com/bee-san/Python-Zero-to-Hero](https://github.com/bee-san/Python-Zero-to-Hero)

## Resources

You should roughly know these things. I have linked to some of my own resources for you to learn them:

* [Python](https://github.com/bee-san/Python-Zero-to-Hero) \(Not an expert, you can use other languages or contribute more languages\)
* [Big O notation](https://skerritt.blog/big-o/) \(not an expert, just the basics\)

For other resources you should see:  


* CTCI
* MIT 6.006

## How to contribute

* Explain things more easily
* Look through my Not Done Yet section and complete / improve them!
