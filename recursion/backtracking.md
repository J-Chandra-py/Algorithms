# Backtracking

## What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is where we incrementally build candidates to solutions, and abandon candidates \(backtrack\) as soon we as determine that candidate is not valid.

Backtracking has 3 key features:

1. Make a change
2. Recurse
3. Undo the change

And Backtracking is often used to solve 3 types of problems:

1. Decision Problem – We search for a feasible solution.
2. Optimisation Problem – We search for the best solution.
3. Enumeration Problem – We find all feasible solutions.

## What Problems can be solved by Backtracking?

Any problem that recursively build candidates to a solution and abandons a candidate \(backtracks\) when it is found to not be valid.
